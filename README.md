# Restaurant-Menu-Practice-Project

Program allows a user to upload their own menu via a comma seperated values list.
The one attached is simply an example, but any should work assuming they follow the same format of

(item 1 name), (item 1 price),  
(item 2 name), (item 2 price),  
etc...

The program then gives the user the option to create a bill in which they can add or remove items from the menu they imported.
It'll calculate the total, including tip, and create a new file called "bill.txt" which shows the quantity of each item, their price,
the subtotal, the amount of tax, the amount of tip, and the total
